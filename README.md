# pixabay-project-backend
server for pixabay project

1. clone the repo
2. open project in vscode (or whatever editor)
3. run "npm install" from terminal from the project folder.
4. start server with "node index.js". If done right the console should say "listening on port 8000" **if running front-end already, refresh the page to fetch images.
